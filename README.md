# Tutorials for Creating a Mega Man in Unity

For the past few months I've been building the components to create a Mega Man clone in the Unity game engine. I started with player control and movement, incorporating ladders, keeping score, bullets, damage, and making clones of the original game enemies. There were no plans on releasing the source code however I'll be doing a short series on YouTube on creating the basic building blocks. I'm keeping it simple at first with setting up the scene, building the player animations, control, movement, bullets, hitboxes and damage, along with coding enemies and their AI. It ~~may be about 4-5~~ will be 10 videos and if there is continued public interest then I may expand upon it.

You can see the current development of my Unity Mega Man on this playlist.
